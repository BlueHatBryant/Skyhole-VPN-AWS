## Blocklist
from The Big Blocklist Collection [https://firebog.net/]
The Internet is full of unsavoury content: advertisers wanting to sell you stuff you don't need, trackers extracting and selling your data as if it were oil, and malicious content vying to hijack your favourite device. This collection hopes to help you minimise these issues, and to maintain a more enjoyable online presence, using the wonderful, free and open source utility known as Pi-hole.
